<br>

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

<br>Docker Compose version 1.27.0+,
<br>[Npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com), [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
<br>
Besides, it's good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### ðŸŽ² Running the App

```bash
# Install all dependencies for backend and frontend
$ npm run install:all

# Run or install the containers in docker, build the app and run db:migrate with this command:
$ npm run compose:up

# If no error occurred, the application should already be working.

# Some useful commands

# Note: the application is already build and the tables have already been created in docker containers when doing the compose:up command, but if there is an error, use the individual commands.

# You can take down and clean docker with:
$ npm run compose:down

# Application build
$ npm run build

# Create the tables in database with migrations
$ npm run db:migrate

# If you want some initial data, you can seed with:
$ npm run db:seed

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev


# The server will start on port:3001 - access <http://localhost:3001>
```

<br>

## Swaggerjs <http://localhost:3001/docs>

<h3>Access the API with Swagger</h3>
<h4>
Most routes need a valid token. If you want to use it, I suggest that you first create a user in the 'Users' session, copy the token that will be generated, and paste it, clicking on the authorize button.
